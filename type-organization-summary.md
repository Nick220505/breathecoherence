# Type Organization Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Product Type Import Fix

- **Issue**: Product type was being re-exported from `src/features/product/types.ts` instead of being imported directly from Prisma
- **Solution**:
  - Removed the re-export of Product type from feature types
  - Updated cart provider to import Product directly from `@prisma/client` (though later changed to use ProductWithCategory)

### 2. Cart Provider Type Correction

- **Issue**: Cart provider was trying to use bare Product type but CartItem requires ProductWithCategory
- **Solution**: Updated cart provider to use ProductWithCategory type for addToCart function parameter

### 3. Order Types Consolidation

- **Issue**: OrderDetails interface was defined locally in checkout success component
- **Solution**:
  - Moved OrderDetails interface to `src/features/order/types.ts`
  - Updated checkout success component to import from feature types

### 4. Chat Feature Types Creation

- **Issue**: Message interface was defined locally in chat-bot component
- **Solution**:
  - Created new `src/features/chat/types.ts` file
  - Moved Message interface to chat feature types
  - Updated chat-bot component to import from feature types

### 5. Image Field Standardization

- **Issue**: Multiple components were using `imageUrl` property but Prisma schema uses `imageBase64`
- **Solution**: Updated all components to use the correct `imageBase64` field:
  - Checkout page
  - Cart button component
  - Custom blend form component
  - Product details component

### 6. Product Object Creation Fixes

- **Issue**: Components creating custom product objects weren't matching full ProductWithCategory type
- **Solution**:
  - Updated custom blend form to provide complete category object with all required fields
  - Updated product details to use existing product object instead of recreating partial objects

## Files Modified

### Type Files

- `src/features/product/types.ts` - Removed Product re-export
- `src/features/order/types.ts` - Added OrderDetails interface
- `src/features/chat/types.ts` - Created new file with Message interface

### Component Files

- `src/providers/cart-provider.tsx` - Updated to use ProductWithCategory
- `src/app/[locale]/(shop)/checkout/success/components/checkout-success-client.tsx` - Import OrderDetails from features
- `src/app/[locale]/components/chat-bot.tsx` - Import Message from features
- `src/app/[locale]/(shop)/checkout/page.tsx` - Fixed imageUrl → imageBase64
- `src/app/[locale]/components/header/cart-button.tsx` - Fixed imageUrl → imageBase64
- `src/app/[locale]/(shop)/store/custom-blend/components/custom-blend-form.tsx` - Complete type compatibility fix
- `src/app/[locale]/(shop)/store/product/[id]/components/product-details.tsx` - Simplified object passing

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Type Safety**: All data-related types now live in appropriate feature modules
2. **Consistent Field Usage**: Standardized on `imageBase64` field name across codebase
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated duplicate interface definitions
4. **Improved Organization**: Types are now logically grouped by domain (order, chat, product)
5. **Build Success**: All type errors resolved, successful build achieved

## Type Organization Philosophy

- **Data Types**: Moved to respective feature type files (order, product, chat)
- **Component Props**: Kept in component files as they're UI-specific
- **Direct Imports**: Prisma types imported directly where needed instead of re-exports
- **Complete Objects**: Ensured all created objects match expected type definitions fully
