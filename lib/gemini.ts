## About Flower Essences

Flower essences are natural preparations extracted from specific flowers in their natural habitat, carefully crafted to maintain their purity and energy. These essences are known for their ability to harmonize and balance our energetic body, acting as liquid vibration and consciousness.

When we use flower essences, we're interacting with the vital energy of flowers. Each flower possesses a unique vibration that is transmuted into the floral essence. When entering our system, these vibrations can help:

- Release emotional and energetic blockages
- Promote wellbeing and balance
- Facilitate connection with our emotions
- Foster greater understanding and inner clarity
- Harmonize the body's energy centers
- Guide us towards greater peace and equilibrium
